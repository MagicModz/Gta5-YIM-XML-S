the animDictsCompact are all the game animations in one large file, 
All xml's working for map just takes a second to load and for the vehicles some may be bugged but there is almost 2k custom cars and merged cars

JUST DRAG ALL XMLS INTO THE CORRECT YIM MENU FILE LOCATIONS FOR VEHICLE AND MAP THEN OPEN YIM MENU REFRESS WORLD XML AND VEHICLE XML AND THEY SHOULD ALL BE THERE
